# GraphHS
At team GraphHS, we aim to target users who are learning to graph mathematical functions, whether they're in high school or college.
It's an efficient way to read graphs, and upload a text file with equations written inside. Our goal for GraphHS is to help high school and college students understand graphing at a basic level.
